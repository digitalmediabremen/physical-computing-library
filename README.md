# Physical Computing Library

The Physical Computing Library (PCL) is a curated collection of electronical components ( like sensors and actuators ) which students may borrow. The online catalog can be browsed at [pcl.digitalmedia-bremen.de](https://pcl.digitalmedia-bremen.de).

Instructions on how to borrow components from, how to contribute to and how to contact the library can be found on the libraryâ€™s [website](https://pcl.digitalmedia-bremen.de) under `Help`.

## Improving the Library

The PCL is in a perpetual state of flux; new components are added, exiting components break, links to external resources go dark. In order to improve the library and to keep it in the best possible shape, everyone is encouraged to help. If a bug is discovered, if there is an idea for a new component or for the improvement of an existing one, please use this repositories *Issues* tracking system to file an [issue](https://github.com/digitalmediabremen/physical-computing-library/issues).
